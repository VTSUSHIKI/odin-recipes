    Instructions:

Cook the noodles: Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the lasagna noodles and cook according to package directions until al dente. Drain and set aside.   
Make the meat sauce: In a large skillet, brown the ground beef and Italian sausage over medium heat. Drain off any excess grease. Add the onion and garlic, and cook until softened. Stir in the crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, tomato paste, oregano, basil, salt, and pepper. Bring to a simmer and cook for 30 minutes, or until thickened.
Assemble the lasagna: In a 9x13 inch baking dish, spread a thin layer of meat sauce. Top with a layer of lasagna noodles, overlapping as needed. Spread with a layer of ricotta cheese, then sprinkle with Parmesan and mozzarella cheese. Repeat layers until all ingredients are used, ending with a layer of meat sauce and cheese.
Bake: Cover with aluminum foil and bake in a preheated 375°F (190°C) oven for 30 minutes. Uncover and bake for an additional 20-25 minutes, or until the cheese is bubbly and golden brown.
Let it rest: Let the lasagna rest for 10-15 minutes before serving.
