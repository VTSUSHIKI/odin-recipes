  <h1>Brazilian Steak</h1>
  <ol>
    <li>1.5-2 pounds picanha steak (ask your butcher for a good quality cut)</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon black pepper</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
    <li>1/4 teaspoon onion powder</li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    Instructions:
    <br>
    Prepare the steak: Remove any excess fat from the picanha, leaving the cap intact. Pat the steak dry with paper towels.
    Season: Rub the olive oil, salt, pepper, garlic powder, and onion powder over the entire surface of the steak.
    Grill or pan-sear:
    Grill: Preheat your grill to medium-high heat. Grill the steak for about 10-12 minutes per side, or until it reaches your desired level of doneness.
    Pan-sear: Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the steak and cook for about 5-7 minutes per side, or until it reaches your desired level of doneness.
    Rest: Allow the steak to rest for about 5-10 minutes before slicing. This will help the juices redistribute.
    Serving Suggestion:
    <br>
    Slice the picanha against the grain into thin slices.
    Serve with chimichurri sauce, farofa (a Brazilian crumbly side dish), and your favorite grilled vegetables.
    Note: For a more authentic Brazilian experience, consider using a churrascaria-style grill that allows you to cook the steak over an open flame.
